# 2.	Architectural and Component-level Design
## 2.1 System Structure

 ![UML Compoent diagram](Images\UMLMVC.png)
 
 We adopted the MVC pattern for our architecture. Our model is responsible for data retrieval, manipulation, and processing and works closly with the controller. The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling the user interface elements. It is responsible for the visual and interactive parts. The controller is the middle man in between the two, where it handles user action logic and communicates with the Model to create, retrieve, update, or destroy the data accordingly.


By abstracting out system in 3 compoents we designate responsibilies. This when we for say want to change a visual element in the view, it wont effect how the Model and Controller functions. Thus reducing coupling. As for reuse posts Models are used in many controllers and usecases can be reused in simalar cases


## 2.2 Subsystem Design 

(**Note1**: This is just a suggested template. If you adopted a pattern other than MVC, you should revise this template and the list the major subsystems in your architectural design.)

(**Note2**: You should describe the design for the end product (completed application) - not only your iteration1 version. You will revise this document in iteration-2 and make changes  and/or add more details in iteration-2.)

### 2.2.1 Model

Briefly explain the role of the model. 

(***in iteration-1***) Include a list of the tables (models) in your database and explain the role of each table. Provide the attributes of the tables (including relationships).

| ResearchPost                  |
|-------------------------|
|ResearchPost is the table for each research post position |
| -id <br> -title <br> -description <br> -qualifications <br> -major <br> -timestamp <br> +/-applications |
||

| Apply                  |
|-------------------------|
|Apply is the table that holds the data of the application for the researchpost. |
| -id <br> -research_topic <br> -statement <br> -faculty_name <br> -faculty_email <br> +/-researchpost_id  |
||

(***in iteration -2***) Revise the database model. Provide a UML diagram of your database model showing the associations and relationships among tables. Your UML diagram should also show the methods of your models.

### 2.2.2 Controller

Briefly explain the role of the controller. If your controller is decomposed into smaller subsystems (similar to the Smile App design we discussed in class), list each of those subsystems as subsections. 

For each subsystem:
 * Explain the role of the subsystem (component) and its responsibilities.
 * 	Provide a detailed description of the subsystem interface, i.e., 
    * which other subsystems does it interact with?  
    * what are the interdependencies between them? 

**Note:** Some of your subsystems will interact with the Web clients (browsers). Make sure to include a detailed description of the routes your application will implement. For each route specify its “methods”, “URL path”, and “a description of the operation it implements”.  
You can use the following table template to list your route specifications. 

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify all routes you need to implement for the completed application and explain each route briefly. If you included most of the major routes but you missed only a few, it maybe still acceptable. 

(***in iteration-2***) Revise your route specifications, add the missing routes to your list, and update the routes you modified. Make sure to provide sufficient detail for each route. In iteration-2, you will be deducted points if you don’t include all major routes needed for implementing the required use-cases or if you haven’t described them in detail.

|   | Methods           | URL Path   | Description  |
|:--|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------|
|1. |                   |            |              |
|2. |                   |            |              |
|3. |                   |            |              |
|4. |                   |            |              |
|5. |                   |            |              |
|6. |                   |            |              |


### 2.2.3 View and User Interface Design 

Briefly explain the role of the view. Explain how you plan to build the user interfaces and mention the frameworks/libraries you plan to use (e.g., Bootstrap).  

Provide a list of the page templates you plan to create (or you already created). Briefly describe the information that will be displayed on those pages and the forms that will be rendered (i.e., explain the input and output for each page). Make sure to mention which use-cases in your “Requirements Specification” document will utilize these interfaces for user interaction. You can supplement your description with UI sketches or screenshots. 

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify the pages that you think should be created.  If you included most of the major pages, it will be acceptable. 

(***in iteration-2***) Revise your page list and descriptions and include any additional pages that you will include in your view.  In iteration-2, you will be deducted points if your view description is still superficial and doesn't list and explain all pages of your application. 


# 3. Progress Report

Write a short paragraph summarizing your progress in iteration1 / iteration2.

Iteration 1: Iteration 1 went smothly but there were some problems with branches and miscommunication. Even so we made sure to get everyone involved and made sure that everyone wasn't stuck with any problems. We currently have to many templates that can be shorten if we add logins/users to the application but nontheless we managed to give out a running demo.

# 4. Testing Plan

(***in iteration 1***)
Don't include this section.

(***in iteration 2***)
In this section , provide a brief description of how you plan to test the system. Thought should be given to  mostly how automatic testing can be carried out, so as to maximize the limited number of human hours you will have for testing your system. Consider the following kinds of testing:
  * *Unit Testing*: Explain for what modules you plan to write unit tests, and what framework you plan to use.  (Each team should write automated tests (at least) for testing the routes)
  * *Functional Testing*: How will you test your system to verify that the use cases are implemented correctly? 
  * *UI Testing*: How do you plan to test the user interface?  (Manual tests are OK)

# 5. References

Cite your references here.

For the papers you cite give the authors, the title of the article, the journal name, journal volume number, date of publication and inclusive page numbers. Giving only the URL for the journal is not appropriate.

For the websites, give the title, author (if applicable) and the website URL.

# Appendix: Grading Rubric
